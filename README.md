# OOP-Assignment
# 📚 OOP Assignment - Week 5

### By [William Oneka](https://github.com/OneWilly)

This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Python. It includes a custom class design with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, as well as a fun polymorphism challenge using vehicle movement behaviors.

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

### ✅ Features Implemented:
- **Class:** `Book`  
- **Subclass:** `EBook` (inherits from `Book`)
- **Encapsulation:** `_pages` is a protected attribute
- **Polymorphism:** `describe()` is overridden in `EBook`
- **Methods:** `describe()`, `read()`, `download()`
- **Constructors:** Used to initialize each object with unique values

### 🔍 Example Output:
```python
'1984' by George Orwell, 328 pages.
You start reading '1984'.
'Sapiens' (eBook) by Yuval Noah Harari, 443 pages, 5MB.
Downloading 'Sapiens'...

🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
This activity showcases polymorphism by defining a common move() method across different vehicle classes.

✅ Classes:
Vehicle (base class)

Car → move() returns "Driving 🚗"

Plane → move() returns "Flying ✈️"

Boat → move() returns "Sailing 🚤"

🔍 Example Output:
python
Copy
Edit
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing 🚤
